# MultimediaSystems
This repository will contain all the code for both the prototypes and the final project we will be presenting for MultiMedia Systems, a course of the MSc. Computer Science at Leiden University, taught by Dr. M. Lew, fall 2019.

## PAD Emotional Mixer
Our concept is to live mix background music, suitable for roleplaying games or other cases where you would need adaptive background music. The music will be mixed based on their 3D emotional content.
